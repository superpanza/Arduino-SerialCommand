SerialCommand
=============
A Wiring/Arduino library to tokenize and parse commands received over a serial port. 

The original version of this library was written by [Steven Cogswell](http://husks.wordpress.com) (published May 23, 2011 in his blog post ["A Minimal Arduino Library for Processing Serial Commands"](http://husks.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/a-minimal-arduino-library-for-processing-serial-commands/)).

This is a fork of a heavily modified version with smaller footprint and a cleaned up code by [Stefan Rado](https://github.com/kroimon/Arduino-SerialCommand).

Here you can run SerialCommand over any Hardware Serial available on Arduino Due or Mega, like Serial, Serial1, Serial2, Serial3.

If you want to use SerialCommand in the "classic way" pass Serial to the constructor.

Enjoy.
